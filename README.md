# Welcome to my repository for MCGalaxy tools!
Here you will find the source of my plugins and commands, free to use however you please. If a command/plugin isn't compiling or working as it should, make a new issue [here](https://github.com/VenkSociety/MCGalaxy-Tools/issues) and I'll get to it when possible. Command/plugin requests are **open** and you can suggest them [here](https://github.com/VenkSociety/MCGalaxy-Tools/issues).

You can find a list of my plugins and commands as well as their features  [here](https://github.com/VenkSociety/MCGalaxy-Tools/wiki/list).

### How to install plugins:
1. Put the plugin's .cs file into the **./plugins/** folder. If it's not there, make a new folder and put it in there.
2. Either in-game or via the server console, type **/pcompile [plugin name]**. It should say **Plugin compiled successfully.**, if it doesn't, make an issue [here](https://github.com/VenkSociety/MCGalaxy-Tools/issues).
3. Now type **/pload [plugin name]**. It should say **Plugin loaded successfully.**
4. And you're done, enjoy your plugin.
